It's interesting to note that the median stress level is not really different between the two operating systems, but the distribution of stress actually is: Figure 1 shows that most Windows users are concentrated around higher stress levels, whereas a significant part of Mac users present mid-low levels of stress (< 7 in the 0-10 scale).
