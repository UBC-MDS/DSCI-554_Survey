### Ideas for Survey Questions


1. How would you rate your level of stress in the MDS program?
  - Scale 1-5? 1- 10?
  - 1 = little or no stress
  - 5 or 10 = great deal of stress
  - Note, the APA uses  a "10-point scale where 1 is little or no stress and 10 is a great deal of stress" in its annual stress survey

1. (alternative) How often do you feel stress-related symptoms connected with MDS activities? *Ex: Tense body, hard time feeling relaxed, irritability, anger, feelings of worry, etc.*
- 1. Never
- 2. Almost never
- 3. Some of the time
- 4. Most of the time
- 5. Almost always

(for remaining questions, should we have categories or allow free responses?)  
(**Gabriel**: I'd say categories! Simplify analysis.)
