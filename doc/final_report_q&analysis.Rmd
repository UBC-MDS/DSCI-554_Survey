## Question

##### Research Question

Does laptop operating system influence a person's self-rated level of stress in the MDS program?

## Analysis

We performed a linear regression analysis on our data with our response being `stress` and our predictors including `os`, `coding`, `background`, `work_year`, `age`, `gender`. 

`lm(stress ~ os + coding + background + work_year + age + gender, data = data)`

Our model was additive as we don't have enough data nor reasons from our hypothesis to include interactions.
