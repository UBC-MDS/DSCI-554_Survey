# Operating System vs. Stress Level in MDS

### Research Question

Does laptop operating system influence a person's self-rated level of stress in the MDS program?


### Potential Survey Questions to Target Confounders

How would you rate your coding skills?  

- Say Linux users report higher computing proficiency in general. They may report lower levels as stress because they are more proficient at coding, not because they are using Linux.   

What subject did you study as an undergraduate?  

- Some fields may have a de facto operating system that they use; this would affect an individual's choice of operating system. Further, if someone studied subjects closely related to data science (e.g. math or CS), they may report lower levels of stress than someone who previously studied subjects that are only tangentially related to data science.  

How many years of professional experience do you have?  

- How much work experience an individual has could affect how well they handle stress. For example, many years in a high-stress job may condition a person to better handle stress. Also, many large enterprises use Windows, so using Windows at work could affect an individual's choice of laptop operating system.  

What gender do you identify with?  
  
- One gender could have a preference for a particular operating system or could be more predisposed to stress.  

What is your age?  

-  Age could influence an individual's ability to weather stress, and could also influence their choice of operating system (e.g. older people might prefer Windows).   

### Statistical Tests
- Linear Regression

### Ethical Consideration
- Handling personal information (age, gender)...
